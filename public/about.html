<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Vince, an aspiring web developer, musician, and mountain biker.</p>

<p>My two biggest hobbies are creating music and mountain biking. I write, record, produce, mix, master, and release 
  all of my music myself. Additionally, I play all the instruments (including guitar, bass, drums, synth/piano) and record
  my own vocals. It can be found anywhere music is streamed ie. Youtube, Spotify, Itunes etc. under the name
  Conquer the Search.</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to showcase the projects I've completed through Udemy in my journey to learn how to code.</p>
